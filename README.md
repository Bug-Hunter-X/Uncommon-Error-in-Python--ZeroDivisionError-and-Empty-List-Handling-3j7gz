This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python related to handling empty lists and lists containing zero when calculating the average. The initial code has a potential issue of returning zero for both an empty list and a list containing only zero, which might not be the desired behavior in all scenarios. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle these situations for more robust code.
